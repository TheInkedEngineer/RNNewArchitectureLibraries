## TOC

* [[Setup] Use the colored-view from other branch](#colored-view)
* [[App] Create an app using the latest template](#create-app)

## Steps

### [[Setup] Use the colored-view from other branch]()

To avoid excessive boilerplate, you will use a Fabric Component we already created in other branches of this same repository.

1. Go to [RNNewArchitectureLibraries](https://github.com/react-native-community/RNNewArchitectureLibraries/tree/feat/back-fabric-component-070)
2. Download the colored-view folder into the workspace

### [[App] Create an app using the latest template]()

1. `npx react-native init NewArchitecture --version next`

**Note:** The app is not committed to the repo not to pollute it
