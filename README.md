# React Native New Architecture Library Samples
This repo contains several branches that will help you understand how to setup your libraries for the React Native New Architecture. This should considered as a support material of the official migration guide.

Here you will find runs of the migration guide on empty projects. Every commit is documented and allows to follow over on every step.

You can find also a `RUN.md` file where all the steps are documented in a more human readable format.

Please find a list of the branches below, with more information on which kind of setup they're addressing.
